🧠Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN and MobileNetV2

This project implements a deep learning-based brain tumor classifier that detects four types of brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, notumor, and pituitary) using MRI images. 
It utilizes a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a MobileNetV2-based transfer learning approach.
